The project involves developing machine learning models to predict retail sales for Salesway, a leading retail chain. Utilizing a dataset containing historical sales and customer information, the project aims to improve sales forecasting and optimize inventory management. Key steps include data collection and preparation, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model development using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Lasso Regression. Key performance metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score, and cross-validation scores, were used to evaluate the models. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and ability to generalize, with the goal of enhancing operational efficiency and making data-driven decisions for the retail business.
